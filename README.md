## Team and Gender Analysis Project
This repository contains a collection of R scripts that analyze various aspects of team dynamics and gender differences in team-based projects. The analyses focus on ambition levels, work functions, and teamwork quality across different teams. Below is a detailed description of each script and what it does.

## Files and Descriptions

### 1. `ambition_level_table.R`
This script calculates and analyzes ambition levels among team members. The output is a table that categorizes ambition levels based on certain predefined criteria.

### 2. `gender_distribution_v1.R`
This script analyzes the distribution of hours spent in meetings (such as stand-up meetings) and Scrum Master roles, broken down by gender. 

**Note**: Only the first part of the code is in use, and it calculates the table used in the relevant sheet. The rest of the script may require cleanup.

### 3. `working_tasks.R`
This script focuses on gender differences in the primary work functions of team members. It creates a table that shows the distribution of various tasks (programming, testing, designing, etc.) across male and female team members.

### 4. `workingtasks_composition.R`
This script analyzes how the composition of a team affects the distribution of work tasks, with a focus on gender. It helps understand if certain team compositions lead to different task assignments based on gender.

### 5. `TWQ_standard.R`
This script evaluates the overall teamwork quality (TWQ) across teams. It uses standardized metrics to assess how well teams work together, providing insights into the effectiveness of collaboration.

### 6. `TWQ_Team.R`
This script calculates the mean teamwork quality (TWQ) score for each team. It aggregates the results of individual team members to produce an overall score for the team's collaborative performance.
